### Hey, I'm Julian.

I deÂ­sign and build web & moÂ­bile soÂ­luÂ­tions, mainÂ­ly for huÂ­man beÂ­ings. I'm a freeÂ­lance fullÂ­stack enÂ­giÂ­neer workÂ­ing with TypeÂ­Script, ReÂ­act, Node.js and the wider JS ecosysÂ­tem. Drop me a line if you think that I can help you with anyÂ­thing in that regard.
